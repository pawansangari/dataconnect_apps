## 🔧 Customization Quick Tips

### Change App Name
Edit `deploy.sh`, line 7:
```bash
APP_NAME="your-app-name"
```

### Change Your Email in Workspace Path
Edit `deploy.sh`, line 8:
```bash
WORKSPACE_PATH="/Workspace/Users/YOUR_EMAIL@databricks.com/apps/$APP_NAME"
```

### Modify UI Colors
Edit `frontend/src/index.css`:
```css
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #YOUR_COLOR 0%, #YOUR_COLOR 100%);
```

### Add More Demo Tasks
Edit `backend/main.py`, find the demo_tasks array and add more:
```python
demo_tasks = [
    {"title": "Your task", "description": "Details", "priority": "high"},
    # Add more here
]
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "npm: command not found"
**Fix:** Install Node.js
```bash
brew install node
# Then run deploy.sh again
```

### Error: "databricks: command not found"
**Fix:** Install Databricks CLI
```bash
pip install databricks-cli
databricks configure --host YOUR_WORKSPACE_URL
```

### Error: "App deployment failed"
**Check:** App status
```bash
databricks apps get task-manager-demo
```

**Fix:** Look at the error message and:
- Check your workspace path is correct
- Verify CLI is authenticated
- Ensure no typos in app name

### App Not Loading in Browser
**Wait:** First deployment takes 2-3 minutes
**Verify:** App status is "RUNNING"
```bash
databricks apps get task-manager-demo | grep state
```

### Frontend Shows Blank Page
**Rebuild:** React app
```bash
cd frontend
rm -rf build
npm run build
cd ..
./deploy.sh
```
